    and insert tags from tag parser


- keep track of date that last post was taggered

   the tagger parser should look for words from 
   a user supplied dictionary, for hashtags and wiki tags
   and by using a tf-idf algorithm

   one should have the option to only tagger new posts
   or to retagger all posts based on a new or incrementaly 
   new tag dictionary
